<p>hi. it's march already. it's been roughly a month since my birthday and it's been 2 months since i've been studying for something that will maybe define my future, the brazilian equivalent of the sat. the thing is: where i live, you can take it as installments (i'm not sure if that's the best way to put it), taking a test in 10th grade with 10th grade stuff in it, 11th grade with 11th grade stuff, etc. i'm kinda stressing out over it since... um. i did horribly on the last one i did. okay BUT, in the last year you do the whole thing (the three comprised) and then the grade for entering your uni is chosen like this: they will calculate the full thing and also get the 12th grade questions from the full and add it with the rest. if the grade on the "installment" type is higher, you go with that. if not, you go with the full thing</p>
<p>it's confusing as fuck and like... yeah? i'm studying a lot in hopes i'll do well this year... i don't wanna be stuck studying for it a year after i finish school while (i believe) almost all my friends and classmates will have started uni :-(</p>

<p>overall, things have been... pretty chill these days. i'm still finding a bit of time to do what i love and honestly that's what matters! i'm looking into writing more journal entries and making a pok√©mon journal ^^ also i'm not sure if you noticed, but i'm starting to dither a few images here and there... i mean the microblog is pretty dithered but that was intentional! i'm dithering stuff in hopes of reducing load times and the amount of space they take up. that was short but oh well, see ya! :-)</p>
